This guide is designed orient new and prospective data providers to Symbiota, a tool for managing and publishing fossil specimen data.

# Introduction
## What is Symbiota?

[Symbiota](https://github.com/Symbiota/Symbiota) is open source software guided by the [Darwin Core](http://dwc.tdwg.org/terms) data standard for creating themed data portals to help people share and manage biodiversity data. The PDP utilizes the version of Symbiota code that is developed by the [Symbiota Support Hub](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/misc/contacts.php](https://symbiota.org/about-us)) (SSH), a University of Kansas-based team dedicated to the technical and social implementation of Symbiota-based data portals. The SSH provides technical support for PDP users‚Äîlike nightly portal backups and routine code upgrades‚Äîwhereas the portal's [Steering Committee](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/misc/contacts.php) provides guidance on best practices related to the management of fossil specimen data.

## What is the "Paleo Data Portal"?
The [Paleo Data Portal](https://paleo.symbiota.org) ("PDP") is a Symbiota-based data portal hosted by the Symbiota Support Hub that exists to:
- Provide **low barrier-to-entry** data mobilization platform
- Increase **data accessibility** for research use
- **Build community** with and among fossil collections not previously engaged in digitization efforts
- **Integrate with [PDWG](https://paleo-data.github.io/about)‚Äôs efforts** to develop best practices in paleo data management and publishing
- Provide a **testing ground** for technical solutions, e.g. those related to taxonomy

## How to participate
If you manage a fossil collection and would like to use this portal to manage your specimen data, first carefully review the portal's [community guidelines](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/includes/usagepolicy.php). If the portal seems suitable for your needs after reviewing this information, please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/VGH9Rqg4ujpNcj1C8). Once your responses are received, someone from the Steering Committee](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/misc/contacts.php) will be in touch.

# Getting started
## Data preparation
‚ÄºÔ∏è If you maintain existing digital catalog records in a spreadsheet, this information can be imported into the Paleo Data Portal. Data providers are strongly advised to refer to the guide, [_How to prepare your data for import into Symbiota_](), prior to ingesting new data in the portal. 

## Essential functions
This section of the guide will provides an introduction to the portal's essential functions for data providers.
