# Onboarding guide for new data providers


This guide is designed orient new data providers to using the [Symbiota Paleo Data Portal](https://paleo.symbiota.org) ("PDP") for managing and publishing fossil specimen data. Prior to getting started, new users are also encouraged to familiarize themselves with the portal's [community guidelines](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/includes/usagepolicy.php).

## What is Symbiota?

[Symbiota](https://github.com/Symbiota/Symbiota) is open source software guided by the [Darwin Core](http://dwc.tdwg.org/terms) data standard for creating themed data portals to help people share and actively manage biodiversity data. The PDP utilizes the version of Symbiota code that is developed by the [Symbiota Support Hub](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/misc/contacts.php](https://symbiota.org/about-us)) (SSH), a University of Kansas-based team dedicated to the technical and social implementation of Symbiota-based data portals. The SSH provides technical support for PDP usersâ€”like nightly portal backups and routine code upgradesâ€”whereas the portal's [Steering Committee](https://paleo.symbiota.org/portal/misc/contacts.php) provides guidance on best practices related to the management of fossil specimen data.

## What is the Paleo Data Portal?

*INSERT CONTENT ABOUT GEO OSE GRANT*

The Paleo Data Portal is hosted by the Symbiota Support Hub and aims to:
- Provide **low barrier-to-entry** data mobilization platform
- Increase **data accessibility** for research use
- **Build community** with and among fossil collections not previously engaged in digitization efforts
- **Integrate with [PDWG]()â€™s efforts** to develop best practices in paleo data management and publishing
- Provide a **testing ground** for technical solutions, e.g. those related to taxonomy

## Using the Paleo Data Portal for collections management

This guide will provide an introduction to the portal's essential functions fo data providers, including information about how to...
- Access your collectionâ€™s dataset
  - View the various control panels
  - Grant/redact user permissions/access
  - Manage your collections metadata
  - Backup your data
- Add/edit records
- Manage taxonomy
- Publish your data

**Callout**
Access the portal at [paleo.symbiota.org](https://paleo.symbiota.org)

### Accessing your dataset

Your dataset, or "collection profile," can be found by going to *Sign in > My Profile > Occurrence Management*. Here you will see two panels: (1) Data Editor Control Panel and (2) Administration Control Panel. **Data Editor** enables activities typically completed by volunteers, interns, and other individuals who do not need full administrative access. **Administration** is only visible to users with admin access, e.g. collections managers, curators, etc.

### Managing users

In the **Administration Control Panel**...
